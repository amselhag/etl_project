## Data sources
This project uses two data sets scraped from indeed.com. Each data set includes data for current job postings on Indeed.com with the job title "Data Analyst" and located in Austin, TX. Data scraped for each set includes:

1. Job Posting Search Results
* Job Title
* Company
* Location (zip code)
* Job URL

2. Job Description
* Job URL
* Job Description Text

## Decisions you made to do cleanup (transform) and join (transform)
* Renamed headers
* 

## How you decided on database tech to store, and schema to store.
* 

## Potential analysis to do on the newly formed dataset
* 

## Challenges you overcame.
* We wanted to scrape text for the entire job description. The first data set included some of the text, but only the first few lines of the JD.
